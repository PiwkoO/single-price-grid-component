## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOCSS methodology

### What I learned

Small but fun project for OOCSS practice. It always takes time to came up with good element's class name so, the more I write the easier it becomes I suppose. 

### Continued development

If I have a chance I will definitely write more of different CSS methodologies than BEM. It's always good to know more because no one knows which team you'll be working with in the future. These kind of small projects allows to practice this kind of thing.
